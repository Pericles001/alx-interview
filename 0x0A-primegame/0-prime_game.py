    Maria and Ben are playing a game.Given a set of consecutive integers
    starting from 1 up to and including n, they take turns choosing a
    prime number from the set and removing that number and its
    multiples from the set.
    The player that cannot make a move loses the game.

    They play x rounds of the game, where n may be different for each round.
    Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally,
    determine who the winner of each game is.
